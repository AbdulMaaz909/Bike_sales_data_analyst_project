# Bike_sales_data_analyst_project

The Bike Sales Dashboard shows how different factors affect bike purchases. Married people and those with higher incomes are more likely to buy bikes. Most bike buyers are adults, and commute distance and education also play a role. Men tend to buy bikes more than women, and buying habits also change based on the region.

There are following questions of this project.
1) Which combination of region and marital status shows the highest bike purchase rate?
2) How does average income vary between customers who purchase bikes versus those who don't, across different education levels?
3) What is the relationship between commute distance and bike purchases across age groups?
4) Which gender has the highest bike purchase rate, and how does it vary by marital status?
5) What is the impact of age bracket on bike purchases, and does it differ across regions?

CONCLUSION:
The dashboard highlights that bike purchases are influenced by factors like marital status, income, age, and region. Adults with higher incomes and shorter commute distances are more likely to buy bikes. Married individuals and men show higher purchase rates. Regional differences and education levels also play a significant role in customer preferences.
